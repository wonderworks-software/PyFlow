All the standard features of application main windows are provided by PyQt.

Main windows can have pull down menus, tool bars, and dock windows. These
separate forms of user input are unified in an integrated action system that
also supports keyboard shortcuts and accelerator keys in menu items.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
