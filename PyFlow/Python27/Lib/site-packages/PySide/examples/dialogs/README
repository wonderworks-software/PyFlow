PyQt includes standard dialogs for many common operations, such as file
selection, printing, and color selection.

Custom dialogs can also be created for specialized modal or modeless
interactions with users.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
