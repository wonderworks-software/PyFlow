PyQt is equipped with a range of capable tool classes, from containers and
iterators to classes for string handling and manipulation.

Other classes provide application infrastructure support, handling plugin
loading and managing configuration files.

The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
