PyQt comes with a large range of standard widgets that users of modern
application have come to expect.

You can also develop your own custom widgets and controls, and use them
alongside standard widgets.

It is even possible to provide custom styles and themes for widgets that can
be used to change the appearance of standard widgets and appropriately
written custom widgets.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
