PyQt uses the Phonon cross-platform multimedia framework to play common
multimedia formats.

Applications can be written to take advantage of the native multimedia
technologies on each platform via a consistent cross-platform PyQt API.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
