PyQt's painting system is able to render vector graphics, images, and outline
font-based text with sub-pixel accuracy accuracy using anti-aliasing to
improve rendering quality.

These examples show the most common techniques that are used when painting
with PyQt, from basic concepts such as drawing simple primitives to the use of
transformations.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
