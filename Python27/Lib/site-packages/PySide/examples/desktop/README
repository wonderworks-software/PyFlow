PyQt provides features to enable applications to integrate with the user's
preferred desktop environment.

Features such as system tray icons, access to the desktop widget, and
support for desktop services can be used to improve the appearance of
applications and take advantage of underlying desktop facilities.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
